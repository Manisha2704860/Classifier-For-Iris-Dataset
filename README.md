# Classifier-For-Iris-Dataset
# Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

    pip install seaborn 


# What i built ?

This project is a simple classification model that uses logistic regression to predict the species of iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements. The project utilizes the Iris dataset, a classic multiclass classification problem.

# Why i built it ?

I built this project to demonstrate my understanding of classification algorithms and to practice working with the scikit-learn library. The project showcases how to:

- Load and explore a dataset
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a logistic regression classifier
- Evaluate the classifier's performance using a confusion matrix and accuracy report

# How i built it ?

1. Data Loading: I used the load_iris() function from scikit-learn to load the Iris dataset.
2. Data Exploration: I used seaborn's pairplot to visualize the relationships between the features.
3. Data Splitting: I split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split() from scikit-learn.
4. Model Training: I trained a logistic regression classifier using LogisticRegression() from scikit-learn.
5. Model Evaluation: I evaluated the classifier's performance using a confusion matrix, accuracy report, and accuracy score.
